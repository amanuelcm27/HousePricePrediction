# 🏡 House Price Prediction

A machine learning regression project that predicts housing prices using features like area, number of rooms, and location-based attributes. Various regression models were compared to evaluate predictive power.

## 📌 Objective

Use classical regression techniques to predict house prices and understand the impact of each feature on pricing.

## ✅ Highlights
- Used **Linear Regression**,**Random Forest Regressor** and **XgBoost**
- Achieved **R-2 score** of **86%** with XGBoost Algorithm.
- Engineered features to improve model accuracy.
- Plotted feature importances and price distributions.

## 🧪 Tools Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- seaborn & matplotlib
