# 🏡 House Price Prediction

A machine learning regression project that predicts housing prices using features like area, number of rooms, and location-based attributes. Various regression models were compared to evaluate predictive power.

## 📌 Objective

Use classical regression techniques to predict house prices and understand the impact of each feature on pricing.

## ✅ Highlights
- Used **Linear Regression**, **Ridge**, **Lasso**, and **Random Forest Regressor**.
- Achieved **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** of **2.8** with Random Forest.
- Engineered new features to improve model accuracy.
- Plotted feature importances and price distributions.

## 🧪 Tools Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- seaborn & matplotlib

## 📊 Results
| Model              | RMSE |
|--------------------|------|
| Linear Regression  | 4.2  |
| Ridge Regression   | 3.9  |
| Lasso Regression   | 4.1  |
| Random Forest      | **2.8** |
