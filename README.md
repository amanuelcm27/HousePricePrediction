```markdown
# 🏡 House Price Prediction

A regression-based ML project to predict house prices based on key features like size, location, and number of rooms.

## 📌 Objective

Use regression models to estimate house prices and explore feature importance using the Boston Housing dataset or Kaggle alternatives.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- seaborn / matplotlib

## 📊 Models to Implement
- Linear Regression
- Ridge & Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

## 📈 Goals
- Explore dataset and correlations
- Handle missing values / feature engineering
- Train multiple regression models
- Evaluate using RMSE, MAE, R²

## 🧠 What You'll Learn
- Regression techniques
- Feature importance & regularization
- Model evaluation for continuous output
- Predictive modeling on real-world datasets

## ✅ Completion Checklist
- [ ] Data cleaning & feature analysis
- [ ] Train/test split
- [ ] Model training & evaluation
